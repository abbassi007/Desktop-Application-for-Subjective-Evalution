# Desktop Application For Subjective Evaluation

## Project Details

This repository contains a small desktop application that I implemented for my own research work in order to compare different Tone Mapping Operators (TMOs), used to convert HDR images to LDR images, with the Enhanced Local Tone Mapping (ELTM) Operator which I selected for a small project in my research and implemented, soon I will upload the code here.

## Folder Settings

```javascript
|___Parent Folder
	|
	|___TMO A
	|	|___Images
	|
	|___TMO B
	|	|___Images
	|
	|___Results.txt
```

## Executing/Running the Code

To run the code all you need to do:

1. Download the Repository to your local machine in your favorite folder.
2. Open the "PC Test.sln" in Visual Studio 2019/2017 and run.
3. You can also perform your task without running the Repository by just clicking the PC Test exe application file in Debug/Release folder.
4. Just in case you did not find the Debug/Release folder in the bin folder of the repository.
5. Open "PC Test.sln" in VS 2019/2017 and run whatever mode(Debug/Release) you like.
